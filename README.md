ZoneRush:Maxima
===================


We wanted to find something that combined music and interaction. The first idea that came to us was to make some sort of game that was influenced by music. We were both familiar with bullet hell games, were inspired by all the different variations on this genre. So the combination of music and bullet hell games led to ZoneRush Maxima, where the enemies, sounds and interactions are all designed by music and specific to each level. We hope our vision shines through!
