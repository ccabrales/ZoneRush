![Curl noise](header.png)

Introduction
------------

**!!! WARNING:** this addon uses oF v0.9.0, that is still in development.

This addon provides a particle system with a curl noise. 

The code for the curl noise comes from [dli/flow](https://github.com/dli/flow).

Installation
------------

Just copy the `ofxCurlNoise` folder into your `openFrameworks/addons/` folder.

Usage
-----

You first have to set the OpenGL version to 4.3 in the `main.cpp` of your project before using this addon. You can look at one of the examples to see how to do it.

First, you need to create and setup a `ParticleEmitter`.
After this, you can setup the particle system with the number of particles you want. For the moment, it works well only with a number of particles that is a **power of 2**. Here is how your `ofApp::setup()` should look like:

    void ofApp::setup(){
    	emitter.setup();
    	curlNoise.setup(1024*256);
    }

Then you update the position of your particle emitter and the particle system.

    void ofApp::update(){
    	float x = ...;
    	float y = ...;
    	emitter.update(x, y);
    	curlNoise.update();
    }

Finally you draw the particles.

    void ofApp::draw(){
    	curlNoise.draw(;)
    }

You can use multiple particle emitters.

You can set the turbulence coefficient of the curl noise programmatically by calling `ofxCurlNoise::setTurbulence(float t)`.

The parameters of the emitter is accessible via `ParticleEmitter::parameters` (see examples).

Dependencies
------------
None for the addon.
ofxGui for the examples.

Compatibility
------------
This addon uses oF v0.9.0 (still in development) and OpenGL v4.3 or higher.
It was tested with linux and oF v0.9.0 (commit bb3572dd48a3d2fa5a8ccb01a0b593d8926ec7b2). 

<!-- TODO 
- Fix ParticleEmitter data.id problem (i.e. if we declare a ParticleEmitter that we don't use -> segfault)
